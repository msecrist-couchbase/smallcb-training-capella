  title: What's in this Guided Tour?
  content: |
   In this guided tour, we'll briefly explore
   some key features of Couchbase Server.
   <br/><br/>

   Major features of Couchbase Server are accessed
   through the main menu.
   <br/><br/>

   <span style="color: #666;">
   (On narrow screens,
    click <span class="icon fa-navicon"></span>
    to pop open the main menu.)</span>
   <br/><br/>

   You'll see links like Dashboard, Servers, Buckets, Backup, etc.
   <br/><br/>

   Next, let's look at the Dashboard.

 -
  title: Dashboard
  content: |
   Click on the main menu's <i>Dashboard</i> link.
   <br/><br/>

   The Dashboard gives a real-time sense of the
   cluster's activity and performance.
   <br/><br/>

   At this point, the graphs shouldn't show much activity,
   since we haven't sent any requests into the database yet.
   <br/><br/>

     Dashboard&nbsp;documentation</a>
   <br/><br/>

   Next: let's explore the Servers screen.

 -
  title: Servers
  content: |
   Click on the main menu's <i>Servers</i> link.
   <br/><br/>

   On the Servers screen,
   you can see that we have only a single server (127.0.0.1) in
   the cluster in this test-drive Playground installation.
   <br/><br/>

   The Servers screen is where you can add and remove
   servers from the cluster.
   <br/><br/>

    Servers&nbsp;documentation</a>
   <br/><br/>

   Next: let's explore the Buckets screen.

 -
  title: Buckets
  content: |
   Click on the main menu's <i>Buckets</i> link.
   <br/><br/>

   Data in Couchbase is stored in <i>buckets</i>.
   <br/><br/>

   A bucket holds containers called <i>scopes</i>,
   which in turn holds containers called <i>collections</i>,
   which in turn holds JSON documents.
   <br/><br/>

   In this test-drive Playground installation,
   two sample buckets have been preloaded...
   <ul>
    <li><code>beer-sample</code></li>
    <li><code>travel-sample</code></li>
   </ul>
   <br/>

     Buckets&nbsp;documentation</a>
   <br/><br/>

   Next, let's check out the Documents Workbench.

 -
  title: Documents Workbench
  content: |
   Click on the main menu's <i>Documents</i> link.
   <br/><br/>

   In the Documents Workbench screen, you can find and
   modify your JSON documents.
   <br/><br/>

   The Keyspace control let you examine the documents in a
   specific bucket/scope/collection.
   <br/><br/>

   Try editing and saving a JSON document by clicking on a
   <span class="icon fa-pencil"></span> button in a document row.
   <br/><br/>

   Next, let's learn about the Query Workbench.

 -
  title: Query Workbench
  content: |
   Click on the main menu's <i>Query</i> link.
   <br/><br/>

   You'll see the Query Workbench, which has a Query Editor, where you
   can edit and execute N1QL queries (i.e., SQL for JSON).
   <br/><br/>

   For example, try:
   <br/>
   <code><pre>SELECT * FROM `travel-sample`
   LIMIT 5;</pre></code>
   <br/>

   Execute that query to see results in the Query Results area,
   where you can see different views of the results,
   including Table, JSON, Tree, Plan, etc.
   <br/><br/>

   This welcome tour has only scratched the surface!
   <br/><br/>

   There's a lot more to learn about Couchbase Server --
   check out the
   <a href="https://docs.couchbase.com/home/server.html"
      target="_blank">documentation</a>.
   <br/><br/>

   Also, your test-drive Playground session has many
   <i>live code examples</i>
   in Java, NodeJS, Python, .NET, PHP, etc --
   to show you how to store and access data
   from your application programs by
   calling the Couchbase SDK.
