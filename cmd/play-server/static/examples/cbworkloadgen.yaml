infoAfter: |
  The above cbworkloadgen example runs a workload
  using 4 client threads that will set 10000 docs
  into the beer-sample bucket, with an operations
  ratio of 40% sets (and 60% gets).
  <br/><br/>
  Note the playground will automatically stop any long-running
  user-submitted, sandboxed programs, so you can't keep run a
  user-submitted, sandboxed cbworkloadgen running for a long time.
