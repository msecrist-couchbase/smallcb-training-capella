The Couchbase Shell can do a lot more, including...

- create, retrieve, update and delete JSON docs from the database.

- import and export JSON documents into / out-from the database.

- execute N1QL (e.g., SQL for JSON) queries.

- manage clusters, buckets, stats and system setup.

- and much more...

That's it for this quick tutorial!
