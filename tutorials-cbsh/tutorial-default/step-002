Since the "travel-sample" bucket is available, you can
retrieve documents by using the 'doc get KEY' command.

Try...

  doc get airline_10

The doc command also takes optional flags in order to
format or reshape the output data.

Try...

  doc get airline_10 --flatten

To learn more, try 'help doc' and 'help doc get'.
