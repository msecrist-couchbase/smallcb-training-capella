Couchbase Shell (or cbsh) is a tool to access and work with Couchbase Server.

cbsh is a real shell, like sh or bash, but is aware of structured
or tabular data, as it is built upon the open-source Nushell project.

Try typing...

  ls

...to get a directory listing, and notice that the output is a table.

Then, run 'next' to move to the next step in this tutorial.
