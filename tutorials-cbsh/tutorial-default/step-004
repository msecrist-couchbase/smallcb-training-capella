You can use the query command to run N1QL queries (or
SQL for JSON queries) against the Couchbase Server database.

Try...

    query 'SELECT name, callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5'

And, you can pipe the tabular data to commands like save...

    query 'SELECT name, callsign FROM `travel-sample` LIMIT 5' | save output.csv

Which you can work with as local files...

    cat output.csv

Use 'next' to move to the next step in the tutorial.
